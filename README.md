## Running Journal
Thu 07/23: placed data array and associated methods into a Dataset class

Fri 07/17: added ability to output to HTML document without overwriting it, replacing use of alert pop-up windows (whose contents cannot be copied-and-pasted)

Thu 07/16: implemented basic stats functionality and modularization of calculations; now working on choosing, opening, and reading text files

Wed 07/15: decided that pursuing Node.js file to be called from HTML was pointless (webpage and its JS are client-side, while Node.js is server-side), so write a static webpage with embedded JavaScript, and serve it from a GitHub project page 

Mon 07/13: wrote Hello, world program in JavaScript, using 'node HelloWorld.js' command in Terminal to run at command line

Mon 07/13: installed Node.js 12.18.2 (node@12; comes with NPM 6.14.5) using Homebrew
